# GoogleFoobarJava
Some of the Google Foobar challenges I did in Java.. I did some of the problems in python but I guess I deleted them.



If you want a description of the problems, just google the name of the .java file. (Don't want to make it too easy to google so people copy my answers, just want recruiters to see this).
